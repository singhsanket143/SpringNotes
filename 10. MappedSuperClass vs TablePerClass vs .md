In the Java Persistence API (JPA), a `MappedSuperclass` is used to define a superclass that can contribute its persistent properties and mappings to its subclasses, but itself is not a true entity and cannot be directly instantiated or queried.

The `MappedSuperclass` annotation specifies that the class is a mapped superclass. Subclasses that inherit from a mapped superclass typically use the `Entity` annotation and can have their own additional mappings or database tables.

Here's a simple code example to illustrate the use of `MappedSuperclass`:

```java
import javax.persistence.MappedSuperclass;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;

@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class BaseEntity {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    // other common fields

    // Getters and setters
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // other getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class User extends BaseEntity {

    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
}

@Entity
public class Product extends BaseEntity {

    private String name;
    private Double price;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(Double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `BaseEntity` is a mapped superclass with an ID field. It's marked with `@MappedSuperclass`.
- `User` and `Product` are entity classes that extend `BaseEntity`. They inherit the ID field and can have their own specific fields.
- Each entity (`User` and `Product`) is mapped to its own database table, but they share common mappings from `BaseEntity`.


--------------------------------

In the context of Java Persistence API (JPA) and object-relational mapping (ORM), the `TablePerClass` strategy is one of the inheritance mapping strategies. This strategy specifies that each class in the inheritance hierarchy is mapped to its own database table. This means that each concrete entity class in the hierarchy has a separate table, which includes columns for all of its inherited and declared fields.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of the `TablePerClass` strategy:

1. **Separate Tables**: Each concrete (non-abstract) entity class in the inheritance hierarchy has its own table.
2. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Abstract classes or interfaces at the top of the hierarchy are not directly mapped to a database table.
3. **Data Redundancy**: Fields from superclasses are duplicated across the tables of each subclass. This can lead to data redundancy but avoids the need for joins when querying subclasses.
4. **Querying**: When querying a superclass, a union of all subclass tables is typically performed, which can impact performance.

### Code Example

Here is an example to illustrate the `TablePerClass` strategy:

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public abstract class Vehicle {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String manufacturer;

    // Getters and setters
    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Car extends Vehicle {

    private int numberOfDoors;

    // Getters and setters
    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Truck extends Vehicle {

    private double payloadCapacity;

    // Getters and setters
    // ...
}
```

In this example:
- `Vehicle` is an abstract class annotated with `@Entity` and `@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)`.
- `Car` and `Truck` are concrete classes that extend `Vehicle`. They are each mapped to their own tables.
- The `Car` table will include columns for `id`, `manufacturer`, and `numberOfDoors`.
- The `Truck` table will include columns for `id`, `manufacturer`, and `payloadCapacity`.
- There is no single table that contains all vehicles; instead, each type of vehicle is stored in its own table.
