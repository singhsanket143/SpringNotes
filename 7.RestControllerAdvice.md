`@RestControllerAdvice` and `@ControllerAdvice` are annotations in Spring Framework that assist in handling global, application-wide concerns, particularly in the context of web applications. They are used for different but related purposes:

1. **@ControllerAdvice**
   - **Purpose**: `@ControllerAdvice` is a specialization of the `@Component` annotation, used to declare global exception handlers and other cross-cutting concerns across multiple `@Controller` classes.
   - **Exception Handling**: It allows you to define `@ExceptionHandler` methods that can handle exceptions thrown by methods annotated with `@RequestMapping` (and similar annotations) across the entire application, not just a single controller.
   - **Model Enhancements**: It can also be used to add attributes to the model globally, using `@ModelAttribute` annotated methods.
   - **Data Binding**: You can use it for global data binding customization by annotating methods with `@InitBinder`.

2. **@RestControllerAdvice**
   - **Purpose**: `@RestControllerAdvice` is a variant of `@ControllerAdvice`. It offers the same features but is typically used in conjunction with `@RestController`.
   - **Response Body**: The key difference is that `@RestControllerAdvice` implies the `@ResponseBody` annotation. This means that the response from `@ExceptionHandler`, `@ModelAttribute`, and `@InitBinder` methods will be directly serialized into the HTTP response body.
   - **Use Case**: It is most suitable for RESTful services where the response is usually JSON or XML, whereas `@ControllerAdvice` is more aligned with traditional MVC applications.

Both annotations are part of the Spring MVC framework and play an important role in the design of well-structured, maintainable web applications. They promote the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by allowing common application-wide concerns like exception handling and data binding to be defined in a single, global place rather than duplicated across multiple controller classes.
